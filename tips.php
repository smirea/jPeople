<div class="title">Search Functionality Tips &amp; Tricks</div>
<div class="section" title="General Info">
The search works by comparing each word you insert with a set of attributes specified bellow. For example if you insert : <code>germany</code> it will find all Germans on campus, but if you isert only <code>ger</code> it will find all Germans plus all people named Germaine for example or any other person which has that token in its attributes. <br />
No algorithm can guess exactly what you really want, therefore if you really want to be sure of what you are searching either specify long exact words or use <a href="#">Strict queries</a> (which only search in the field you select)
